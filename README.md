# Sales-window-functions-analytics-case-study - SQL

This project is a comprehensive SQL case study focused on mastering **window functions** using a custom sales database. It showcases how SQL can be used to extract advanced insights for business analysis through real-world analytical queries.

---

##  Overview

Window functions are powerful tools for performing advanced analytical operations in SQL—such as ranking, running totals, moving averages, and comparisons across rows—without grouping or losing row-level detail.

In this case study, I applied various window functions to simulate real business scenarios, such as:
- Customer segmentation
- Sales performance analysis
- Trend comparison over time
- Order ranking and tracking

---

##  Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**
- **MySQL (query syntax references included)**
- pgAdmin (for executing queries)
- Manually created sales database (SQL setup file provided)

---

##  Key Window Functions Used

- `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`
- `NTILE()`, `PERCENT_RANK()`, `CUME_DIST()`
- Aggregates with `OVER(PARTITION BY … ORDER BY …)`
- Use of `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` in analytical use cases

## What I Learned
- Applying SQL window functions to real business problems
- Understanding the difference between window and aggregate functions
- Writing analytical queries for segmentation, trend detection, and ranking
- Commenting and organizing professional SQL projects
